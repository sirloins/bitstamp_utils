Python code to obtain bitcoin price and volome data from Bitstamp.net via the Bitstamp API

The _bitCoinTicker class retrieves ticker data (json format) from bitstamp.net and converts
it to plain html.

This script can run as a server-side include (cgi) from your web page.

Requires Python 2.6 or above.  I have tested it with Python 2.7.3.
